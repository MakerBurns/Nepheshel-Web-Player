----------------------------------------
● About Nepheshel

You find yourself in a bed as you finally regain consciousness.
A girl standing next to the bed you're in is relieved to see you awaken.
She introduces herself as Iris. She runs a pharmacy on the island.
She's tended to your wounds ever since she found you unconscious by the shore.
Your memory is foggy, however. You can't recall why you're here, or what you should be doing...

Inside the bag you had on you, your only possessions are an unusually shaped crystal, a dagger,
and a mysterious book. The contents of the book leave you with more questions than answers:

"Deep within the Confined Isle in the depths of the Ebony Labyrinth, 
sleeps something so wondrous that people must not disturb it."

On the island lie many paths, sprawling like an enormous maze, each one laden with mystery.
Barely remembering your name, you embark on a journey to find the answers you're looking for...

How you came here, your purpose, the mystery of the Ebony Labyrinth...
And most especially; whatever it is that sleeps in the depths of the island.

All of it can only be ascertained by your power alone.

- About the Island
The island is commonly referred to by its inhabitants as "The Confined Isle".
It is said that a powerful curse plagues the island, causing all who enter or leave it to completely
lose their memories.
Furthermore, the island's position appears to constantly change. Seasons are irregular,
and the islands on the horizon appear and disappear as time slowly marches on...

Because of that, leaving or entering the island is no easy feat.
Small settlements with people exist, but their memories of the olden days have long faded away.
It appears that those who could not escape the island's clutches have chosen to settle down...

- About Djinn
In the old days of the island, many powerful entities rested on the island.
They are called "Djinn". The Hero can make some of them his ally to aid him on his journey.
Djinn are sealed within distinct-looking jars, but if one is to open such a jar and lack the
required strength to make a contract with them, the one who opened it may risk their very lives.

Back in ancient times, many greedy adventurers recklessly opened countless Djinn jars,
believing them to be full of treasure. Because of this, there are many hostile Djinn 
on the island who attack and threaten the lives of its inhabitants even to this day.
Djinn are connected to their jars, but they are immortal, and have powers beyond that of man.
Because of their almighty powers, the people trembled in terror whenever a Djinn was summoned
and saw them as no different from monsters, but their exact distinction with them is unclear.


This game is a dungeon-crawler RPG.
However, the dungeons are intricate with some having connections underground. In order to fully 
explore or even access some of the dungeons, you may need to go through another dungeon first.

The game has no one-way path that the player is locked on.
There is hardly anything restricting the player's actions and where they wish to go.

You have a very high amount of freedom.
Since every enemy is visible on the field, it's possible to 
avoid fighting a strong enemy by simply dashing past them.
This makes getting through even the most dangerous dungeons a cakewalk.
But if you get cornered, you'll be lucky to escape with your life...

Use your power to the fullest, and do all that you can to find the truth.

----------------------------------------★Game Info★

- About "Gates"

In Nepheshel, there are monoliths scattered round about The Confined Isle
known as "Gates". You can save your progress at Gates.
However, most Gates will not be active when you first find them.
You need to find and insert a "Gate Crystal" into its indent to activate them.

The Hero will already have a Gate Crystal in his possession at the start of the game.
We highly recommend you put it to good use by inserting it into the Gate near the town's entrance.
 
With Gates, you can instantly travel to another Gate you've activated by entering 
The Gate Dimension. It's a highly effective way of traveling and going to where you want quickly.
Gate Crystals can also be removed even after they're set, so you can carry one with you if you
don't want to deal with the hassle of having to find another.
Just remember, if you take a Gate Crystal out of a Gate's indent, the portal to that Gate won't
appear in the Gate Dimension until it's active again.

- About Levels

The Level Cap in Nepheshel is Level 50.
Try to make the most of stat-enhancing items.
----------------------------------------
- About Status Ailments

Some enemy attacks can change your status, and
afflict you with some highly undesirable effects.
All the ailments you could get afflicted with
in Nepheshel are listed below:

COMATOSE (CANNOT BATTLE):

If an ally's HP falls to 0, they'll fall unconscious and can no longer fight in battle.
If all party members fall unconscious, then it's Game Over!

POISON:

A set amount of HP is lost for each passing turn.
The good news about poison is that it won't outright
knock you out, always leaving you with at least 1 HP.
The bad news is that it also comes in 5 intensities. 
The weakest will only deal 5 points of damage, while
the strongest will inflict a whopping 80 points!
Even worse, stronger intensities will halve your Speed and Offense!
 
The letter shown next to poison when afflicted gauges its intensity.
The 5 intensities and their corresponding letters are listed below:
 
X = LETHAL
A = SEVERE
B = POTENT
C = REGULAR
D = WEAK

PARALYSIS:

Afflicted party members cannot move at all when paralyzed.
This also halves their Defense.

FEAR:

Anyone afflicted with this ailment will go into a high-strung state of panic.
Due to being in such an agitated state, this will halve Offense, Accuracy and Mindpower.
This also prevents party members from using magic.
If you can't cure it right away, defending until it wears off is a good strategy.

CONFUSION:

Those afflicted will fail to discern friend from foe, 
and will attack themselves or allies in their confusion.

FURY:

Driven by anger, afflicted allies will strike the enemy with only their basic attack.
Accuracy, Defense and Mindpower are halved due to this.

SLEEP:

Those afflicted fall into a deep sleep and cannot perform any actions.
While on the snooze cruise, Offense, Defense and Mindpower are halved.
There's a very high chance you'll wake up if you get hit.

BLIND:

Being blinded makes you barely able to see, halving your Accuracy.

STIGMA:

Getting stigmatized corrupts the auras of those afflicted, 
making them completely incapable of casting any magic.

TUMBLE:

You lost your footing and got knocked down to the ground.
Tumbled members can't perform any actions, and need 1 turn to get back on their feet.
When you take a tumble, your Defense is halved.
Unlike other ailments, there's no way to cure tumbled allies early... Or is there?

All ailments occur exclusively in-battle. If you win a battle and are afflicted with any ailment, 
you'll instantly be cured of it when you return to the field.
The only exception is if The Hero is Comatose. Memento mori.
 
---------------------------------------
- Regarding Automatic Recovery

In Nepheshel, all party members gradually regain HP while walking.
Should an ally Djinn be KO'd, they'll automatically revive as you walk on the field.
Unfortunately the Hero (aka you), being an ordinary human, does not have said luxury.
Djinn can also regain a little MP if you dismiss them back to their jars for a while.

---------------------------------------★Strategy Tips★

1. Get as much info as you can!
Start by heading on over to the pub in town, and listen to what the pubkeeper and patrons have to say.
The patrons in the pub seem to come and go throughout the game...

2. You + Preparation = Little to No Worries
Definitely carry more Medical Herbs than you can chew.
There's no harm done in carrying a surplus of medical supplies.
If you do happen to run low though, some foodstuffs may provide remedies to certain ailments...

3. Fleeing is Winning!* (* Results may vary)
Since all enemies are displayed on the field with no random encounters, 
you can simply sneak past them if you're not in the mood for fighting.
In addition, you're able to flee from nearly every boss battle, so don't feel too discouraged
if you feel the need to retreat from a battle that's not going in your favor.
Your chance of successfully fleeing is calculated by comparing the Speed of both you and your enemies.
Of course, this means that trying to flee from faster enemies will be considerably more difficult...

4. Hunt for Hidden Rooms!
While you're busy running away from that outrageously strong enemy that
nearly wiped the floor with you, why not search for some hidden rooms?
There are a lot of hidden rooms throughout Nepheshel.
And the kicker is that there's often a bunch of rare and strong equipment in them!
If you can snag such equipment, you'll be able to mitigate the difference of your Level somewhat.
 
Whether or not you can find these rooms will greatly affect how difficult the game will be for you.
Hidden passages to these rooms are often found on the upper and lower walls, but they can also
be found on the floor occasionally.

5. Can't Slash It? Bash It!
There are 3 primary weapon types in the game, they are Cut, Jab, and Blunt.
You can easily check what type a weapon is by the letters next to their name.
Here's a quick guide:
 [C] = Cut
 [J] = Jab
 [B] = Blunt
If there's a [2] before the letters, then the weapon is two-handed.
Two-handed weapons are usually more powerful, but shields can't be equipped alongside them.
Some enemies may be resistant or completely immune to certain types of physical injury,
so if you're not dealing that much damage, consider using a different kind of weapon.

6. Anti-Magic 101
How much damage you, your allies and enemies take from magic is based on 
their level of Magic Resistance. There are a total of 5 resistance levels:
 
Very Weak	:	Takes double the amount of damage
Weak		:	Takes 1.5 times the amount of damage
Regular		:	Takes normal amount of damage
Resistant	:	Takes half the amount of damage
Immune		:	Takes little to absolutely no damage
 
The Hero starts off with a regular resistance to all magic, but by wearing armor,
charms, and using certain items and spells, you can improve your resistance
against certain types of magic by up to 2 levels. Play your cards right, and
you can become nearly impervious against many kinds of spells.

----------------------------------------★Troubleshooting★

- I can't hear any MIDIs!

	Your sound source is probably being used by a different program.
	Be sure not to use any playback software when playing, and try again.
	
- The music is playing slowly for some reason!

	Go into battle or enter a different dungeon.

- The game crashed on me and said it cannot open file "People1"! What happened?

	This occurred because RPG Maker 2000 Runtime Package (RTP) is not installed on your computer.
	You must have the RPG Maker 2000 Runtime Package installed in order to play this game.
	It can be downloaded from here:
	https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/run-time-package
	
----------------------------------------★Miscellaneous Notes★

- Enemies in the Abandoned Mines may be able to attack you from cliff ledges.
- The number of Herb Bundles you buy amounts to 10 Herbs for each 1 purchased.
- When you buy Herb Bundles, you will be refunded the amount you can't carry.
